# Containerization

## Introduction

A common problem observed during data analysis includes packages/libraries that are not compatible with specific R/Python software. Other times different project use specific versions of packages and the underlying R/Python versions. This leads to "dependency hell" which can be easily solved using virtual environments. A virtual environment is common to isolate the dependency requirements for specific projects which may rely on a specific R/Python version as well as specific versions of the software libraries.

### R

renv, packrat

### Python

Conda is useful package manager and can create virtual environments for pretty much anay programming language ^[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/].



Similar to how shipping containers carry material goods in an enclosed space, software containers consist of application related goods (*e.g.* files and dependencies) in an enclosed environment. Containerization ensure reproducibility by bundling the necessary resources required to run a given set of analyses, web application, pipelines *etc.* irrespective of the operation system (OS). Thus, containers can be run on any OS (*e.g.* Mac, Windows, Linux)^[ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50974960/whats-the-difference-between-docker-and-python-virtualenv].
