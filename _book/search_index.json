[["containerization.html", "Chapter 4 Containerization 4.1 R 4.2 Python 4.3 Delete virtual environment", " Chapter 4 Containerization A common problem observed during data analysis includes packages/libraries that are not compatible with specific R/Python software. Other times different project use specific versions of packages and the underlying R/Python versions. This leads to “dependency hell” which can be easily solved using virtual environments. A virtual environment is common to isolate the dependency requirements for specific projects which may rely on a specific R/Python version as well as specific versions of the software libraries. 4.1 R renv, packrat 4.2 Python Conda is useful package manager and can create virtual environments for pretty much anay programming language.1 4.2.1 Create a virtual environment install conda check conda version using: conda --version 4.2.1.1 with default python version conda create --name env1 conda activate env1 python --version 4.2.1.2 a specifc python version conda create --name env2 python=3.7 conda activate env2 python --version 4.2.2 install packages conda install numpy 4.2.3 exit virtual environment conda deactivate 4.3 Delete virtual environment conda env remove -n env1 conda env remove -n env2 Similar to how shipping containers carry material goods in an enclosed space, software containers consist of application related goods (e.g. files and dependencies) in an enclosed environment. Containerization ensure reproducibility by bundling the necessary resources required to run a given set of analyses, web application, pipelines etc. irrespective of the operation system (OS). Thus, containers can be run on any OS (e.g. Mac, Windows, Linux)2.
